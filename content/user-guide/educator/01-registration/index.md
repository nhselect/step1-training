There are 2 ways that you may be asked to register on the platform, check with your Clinical Centre Manager / Implementation Lead which process to follow:​

- [Self-registration](self-registering-for-your-profile) – you can self-register for a profile via the platform hyperlink. Approval is then required in the platform by either the Clinical Centre Manager or Administrator (unless you self-register using a Trust computer, and the Trust’s IP address was linked during its setup as a DLS centre, then approval won’t be required)​

- [Registration by Clinical Centre Managers or Administrators](being-registered-by-clinical-centre-managers) – Clinical Centre Manager or Administrator can register delegates in the platform. You will either receive an email prompting you to set up a password or your Clinical Centre Manager or Administrator will set up and share your password ​

​This section will outline the different registration processes and how to manage your profile once registered.​
