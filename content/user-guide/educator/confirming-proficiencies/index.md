1. Once the Learner self-assessed a proficiency as 'Achieved' in their Learning portal and sent to you for confirmation, **you will receive an email from noreply@dls.nhs.uk** (Subject: Self Assessment results review request...) requesting you to confirm

   Select the **Click here** hyperlink in email

**OR**

1. Go to the **Supervisor Dashboard** (via the **Supervise** application) in the platform and select the Learner’s request in **Your to do list**

2. Find the proficiencies with the Confirmation status **Confirmation requested**, as these are the ones that have been sent to you

* Those with the status Pending confirmation have been sent to another Educator/Manager or Assessor and you can't confirm these

3. You can either: 

* **Confirm proficiencies individually**  - this way gives you the additional ability to Reject and add an Action plan (not just Confirm)
* **Confirm multiple proficiencies at the same time** - this is faster if you have a lot to confirm (but you can't Reject or add an Action plan)

#### Confirm proficiences individually

* Select **Review** next to the proficiency

* Select **Accept** or **Reject,** write an **Action plan** (if needed, especially if you selected Reject)and select **Submit**

* **Tick the proficiencies to confirm** (or select **Select all proficiencies**) and select **Submit**

4. Once confirmed, the confirmation status will update to **Confirmed** (on your and the Learner's Proficiencies home page)
