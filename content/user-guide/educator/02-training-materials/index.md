**KEY:**
✔ Material provided in training package, * Material’s contents are tailored to role
IL = Implementation Lead; CCM = Clinical Centre Manager; Admin = Administrator; E/M = Educator/Manager; A = Assessor; L = Learner

Someone in your Trust will need to share the hyperlink with each new delegate. 

Delegates can return back to the materials within these training packages at any time, and we recommend they access the online version (vs. download) as we may edit/add materials based on feedback.

Upon initial completion of the training package (required by all delegates for registering for a profile) a certificate of completion will automatically be generated and sent to them by email.
