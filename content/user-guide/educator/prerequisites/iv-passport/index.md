Similar to the paper version, Learners are expected to first record completion of their learning prerequisites before starting self-assessment of the proficiencies. 

The Learner will need to select **Yes** to confirm all of the prerequisites and records of learning at the start of their proficiencies.

Confirmation is then required from either an **Assessor** or **Educator/Manager**.

### Confirming agreement to Learning contract

Once the Learner has selected **Yes** in their learning portal and sent the proficiencies to you for confirmation, you will receive an email from **noreply@dls.nhs.uk** with the subject "Self Assessment results review request", requesting you agree to the Learner contract.

1. Select the **Click here** link in the email

> If the confirmation status is **Pending confirmation**, this means it has been sent to a different Educator/Manager or Assessor for confirmation, and you will be unable to confirm it.

3. Select **Confirm self-assessment response** and then select **Save and continue**
