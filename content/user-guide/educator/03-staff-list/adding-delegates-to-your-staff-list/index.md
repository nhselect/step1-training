> The email address of the delegate must match the address they registered with.
>
> If you do not have this functionality, this means you have been promoted to an Assessor rather than an Educator/Manager. Contact your Clinical Centre Manager to update your role.

4. The **delegate should appear in your My Staff List**

> If you would like to become an Educator/Manager for a Learner who already has an Educator/Manager, the Learner can add you (they can find out how in their User guide) and they will then automatically appear in your My Staff List
