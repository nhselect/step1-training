> Before you can perform either of the below, you must add a delegate to your ‘My staff list’:​
>
> - Promotion of delegate to an Assessor​
> - Enrolment of Learner onto the Step 1 proficiencies​

#### To add a delegate to your My Staff List​

1. Go to Supervisor dashboard (in ‘Supervise’ app) ​

2. Select: View My Staff List​

3. Add the email address of the delegate and click “Submit” (click “Add multiple staff members” if you want to add multiple delegates)​

> The email address of the delegate must match the address they registered with.​
>
> If you do not have this functionality, this means you have been promoted to an Assessor rather than an Educator / Manager. Contact your Clinical Centre Manager to update your role.​

4. In your My staff dashboard the status next to your Learner’s details should now say Confirmed​

> If they are not registered on the DLS platform, the status will update to Not registered and an automatic email from  noreply@dls.nhs.uk will be sent to them, prompting them to self-register​

> If you would like to become an Educator / Manager for a Learner who already has an Educator / Manager, the Learner can add you (they can find out how in their ‘how to’ user guide) and they will then automatically appear in your Staff list​
