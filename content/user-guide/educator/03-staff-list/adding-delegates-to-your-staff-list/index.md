> The email address of the delegate must match the address they registered with.​
>
> If you do not have this functionality, this means you have been promoted to an Assessor rather than an Educator / Manager. Contact your Clinical Centre Manager to update your role.​

4. In your My staff dashboard the status next to your Learner’s details should now say Confirmed​
