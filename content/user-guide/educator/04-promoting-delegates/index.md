1. Go to Supervisor dashboard (in ‘Supervise’ app) ​

2. Select: View My Staff List​

3. Expand (+) the delegate that you would like to promote​

> If you cannot see the delegate listed in your My Staff list you have not added them, see p.19–20 for how to do this.​

4. Select: Promote to Nominated supervisor​

> If you do not see this button this suggests they have already been promoted and their ‘DLS Role’ will say either Supervisor (i.e. Educator/Manager) or Nominated supervisor (i.e. Assessor)​

5. Click: Tick to confirm you are sure​

6. Select: Confirm​

7. Their DLS role will now say ‘Nominated supervisor’​

> Once you have promoted an Assessor, only a Centre Manager can de-promote them (i.e. you cannot de-promote them)​

8. To stop your My Staff List getting long, once promoted you may want to remove the Assessor from your list (you can re-add them again at any point)​
