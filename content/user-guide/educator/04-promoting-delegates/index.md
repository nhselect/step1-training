> If you do not see this button this suggests they have already been promoted and their ‘DLS Role’ will say either Supervisor (i.e. Educator/Manager) or Nominated supervisor (i.e. Assessor)

5. **Tick to confirm** you are sure and select **Confirm**

> Once you have promoted an Assessor, only a Centre Manager can de-promote them (i.e. you cannot de-promote them)

8. To stop your My Staff List getting long, once promoted you may want to **remove the Assessor from your list** (you can re-add them again at any point)
