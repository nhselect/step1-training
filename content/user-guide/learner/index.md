This guide provides you with step-by-step information on how to get setup and start using the DLS platform, which hosts the digitised proficiencies.  

We recommend you have this guide open in a separate window when you start using the platform, so you can follow along.  

The **Navigation** menu lists and numbers the steps in the order you will need to perform as part of your platform role and can be used to move between sections.  

If this is your first time using this guide, and you are at the beginning of your setup, click **Next** at the bottom of the page to work through the steps in order. If you have already started, use the **Navigation** menu to jump straight to the step you are interested in.
