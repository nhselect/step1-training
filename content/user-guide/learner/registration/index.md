There are 2 ways that you may be asked to register on the platform, check with your Clinical Centre Manager / Implementation Lead which process to follow:

- [Self-registration](./registration/self-registering-for-your-profile) – you can self-register for a profile via the platform hyperlink. Approval is then required in the platform by either the Clinical Centre Manager or Administrator (unless you self-register using a computer in your organisation, and the organisation’s IP address was linked during its setup as a DLS centre, then approval won’t be required)

- [Registration by Clinical Centre Managers or Administrators](./registration/being-registered-by-clinical-centre-managers-or-administrators) – Clinical Centre Manager or Administrator can register delegates in the platform. You will either receive an email prompting you to set up a password or your Clinical Centre Manager or Administrator will set up and share your password 

This section will outline the different registration processes and how to manage your profile once registered.
