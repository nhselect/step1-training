Learners who are accessing digital competency frameworks (passports) such as the Digital IV Therapy and Steps can easily transfer a completed or partially completed passport to another centre (organisation). Learners can also access their digital passport, if appropriate, in more than one centre for example a local NHS Trust and a University.

**Please note that digital competency frameworks learners will only be able to see their digital passport in additional centres, if they are registered at that centre and the passport is already available and being delivered digitally at that organisation.**

If you move to a new organisation or need access to your digital passport at another centre you should:

1. Self-register to the new centre following the guidance: Self-register at a new centre
2. If you have been pre-registered by your new centre, youâ€™ll receive a welcome email and you should follow the guidance: I am an existing DLS User

   Learners who are registered in more than one centre will be able to view their passport in both centres, follow the guidance for Switch centre.

   When learners **Launch their self assessment from the Learning Portal** they will be able to choose the appropriate supervisor from their centres to assess and confirm their practice.
