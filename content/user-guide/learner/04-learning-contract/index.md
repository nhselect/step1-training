Similar to the paper version, Learners are expected to first complete their Learning Contract before starting self-assessment of the proficiencies. This should happen via a discussion with the three stakeholders mentioned:

* Learner
* Lead assessor
* Critical care lead nurse/manager 

You will need to select ‘Agree’ on behalf of all three stakeholders in their Learning portal following your conversation.

Confirmation is then required from either the Assessor, Educator/Manager or Clinical Centre Manager.

The individual who provides confirmation in the platform depends on the proficiency and the Trust:

| Learning contract proficiency     | Confirmation required                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Learner responsibilities          | Assessor. In some Trusts, this may be your Educator/Manager or Clinical Centre Manager |
| Lead assessor responsibilities     | Educator/Manager. In some Trusts, this may be your Assessor.                           |
| Critical care lead nurse / manager | Clinical Centre Manager*. In some Trusts, this may be your Educator/Manager.           |

Note: *The Clinical Centre Manager will need a dual-role in the platform (as also an Educator/Manager or Assessor) in order to be able to confirm in the platform. Otherwise someone else with either of these roles could confirm on their behalf.
