Similar to the paper version,â€¯there is an area on the proficiencies to record completion of prerequisite learning and assessments.

1. Go to your **Proficiencies home** page.

2. Expand **Prerequisites to supervised clinical practice**.

5. Once you selected **Submit**, you will return to the proficiencies home page. The completed evidence should now show **Yes** under the self-assessment status.

6. Repeat these steps for each of the remaining prerequisites.

> **Note:** The prerequisites to supervised clinical practice and record of learning and knowledge assessment are both **compulsory** and must be completed **before the other proficiencies**.

Once you have completed recording all the necessary evidence, you will then send this to your supervisor to confirm the completion.
