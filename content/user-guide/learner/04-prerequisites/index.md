For each proficiency framework, you will find a set of prerequisite steps that you must complete and get signed off before you can begin working through the proficiencies themselves.

For example:

- in the IV Therapy Passport you must record completion of the **[prerequisite learning and assessments](./04-prerequisites/iv-prerequisites)** that you have completed
- in the Steps proficiencies, you must read and agree to the **[learning contract](./04-prerequisites/learning-contract)**, which is then also confirmed by both your lead assessor and the critical care lead.

Exactly what actions are required before you begin self-assessing your proficiencies should be explained by your department prior to you gaining access to the platform.
