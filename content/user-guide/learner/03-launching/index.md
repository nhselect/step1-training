4. Select **Manage supervisors**

Here you can see all the Supervisors (Educator/Manager or Assessor) that are managing your Step 1, which means you will be able to send proficiencies to them to confirm and they will be able to see a summary of your progress. 

* You can find out how to [Add / Remove Supervisors from this list](/user-guide/learner/06-confirmation/managing-your-supervisors) later in this guide
* When you first start the Step 1 proficiencies only the Educator/Manager who enrolled you will be listed here.
