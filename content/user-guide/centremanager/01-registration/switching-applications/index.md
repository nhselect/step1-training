This will take you to the Switch application tab in the blue ribbon, where there are three applications (apps) you can choose from.​

* **Learning Portal**: If you are enrolled as a Learner on a course (i.e. another list of proficiencies), you will see this and can access them here​
* **Tracking System**: Access to setup or manage your centre, and register, promote and manage delegates in your centre​
* **Legacy Tracking System**: Ignore this, you don’t need to access it. It will only be available for the pilot​
