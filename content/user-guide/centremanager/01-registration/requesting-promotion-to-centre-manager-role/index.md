1. Contact your Trust-wide Non-clinical DLS Centre Manager (or Clinical Centre Manager if one already exists) and ask them to promote you to an ‘Administrator’ role within the platform (see p.38–42)​

> Search for your Centre and Non-clinical DLS Centre Manager details here:​
>
> https://www.dls.nhs.uk/v2/FindYourCentre​

2. ​Once you have been promoted to Administrator, your Non-clinical DLS Centre Manager (or existing Clinical Centre Manager) needs to raise a ticket with HEE TEL (p. 54) and submit a request for your profile to be promoted to a Centre Manager ​

> HEE TEL should promote you within 2 working days.​
>
> Your Non-clinical DLS Centre Manger (or existing Clinical Centre Manager) should let you know when you have been promoted as you will not receive an automatic notification informing you of this.​

> Once promoted, you will need to log out and log in to your account to see the updated functionalities​
