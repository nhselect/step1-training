2. ​Once you have been promoted to Administrator, your Non-clinical DLS Centre Manager (or existing Clinical Centre Manager) needs to [raise a ticket with HEE TEL](/user-guide/centremanager/07-support/technical-queries) and submit a request for your profile to be promoted to a Centre Manager ​

> HEE TEL should promote you within 2 working days.​
>
> Your Non-clinical DLS Centre Manger (or existing Clinical Centre Manager) should let you know when you have been promoted as you will not receive an automatic notification informing you of this.​

> Once promoted, you will need to log out and log in to your account to see the updated functionalities​
