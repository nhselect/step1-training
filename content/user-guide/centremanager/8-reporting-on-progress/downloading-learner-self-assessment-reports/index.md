Each row within the Excel file is a Learner. For each Learner there are the following columns of data available:

* **PRN:** Personal Reference Number (PRN), if it was inputted

* **Registered**: Date and time the Learner registered onto the platform 
* **Enrolled**: Date and time the Learner was enrolled onto the Step 1 Proficiencies
