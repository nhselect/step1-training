Depending on how far along your Trust is in the implementation phase, your existing Centre Manager will either be a Non-clinical Centre Manager (likely within your IT team) or a Clinical Centre Manager who has already been promoted within the platform.

1. **Email your Non-clinical Centre Manager** (or Clinical Centre Manager if one already exists) and ask them to promote you to a Centre Manager role within the platform. 

   * You may wish to **copy, paste and send** the email below which provides your Non-Clinical Centre Manager some context about the pilot and a link to step-by-step guidance on what they need to do. 

> **Email subject**: DLS Platform - Please help with promotion to Centre Manager 
>
> Dear \[insert Non-Clinical Centre Manager's name], 
>
> As you may be aware HEE TEL have recently started piloting two clinical nursing self assessments on the DLS platform (that historically has only hosted non-clinical IT Skills Pathway proficiencies).
>
> Our Trust has been chosen to be a pilot site for one of these nursing self assessments - "**Step 1 Proficiencies - National Proficiency Framework for Registered Nurses in Adult Critical Care"**
>
> As the Clinical Centre Manager, I will be overseeing the pilot and am contacting you to request promotion to a Centre Manager role within the platform (this will take <5 mins to action). You can find a step-by-step guide on how to do this here: [http://nhs-step1-training.netlify.app/user-guide/non-clinical-centre-managers ](http://nhs-step1-training.netlify.app/user-guide/non-clinical-centre-managers)
>
> **What will this mean for you:**
>
> * Other than promoting me to a Centre Manager, you will not need to do anything else
> * You will remain the main Centre Manager and contact for the HEE DLS team
> * There will be increase in delegate numbers in our Centre Dashboard – however, you should be able to use the filtering options to hide these from your view
>
> **If you have any questions or concerns:**
>
> * You can raise any issues using the existing Support Ticket function in the platform
> * NHS Elect ([learningnetwork@nhselect.org.uk](mailto:learningnetwork@nhselect.org.uk)) are overseeing implementation during the pilot, so please contact them if any queries
>
> Thank you in advance for your support,

2. ​Once your Non-clinical Centre Manager (or existing Clinical Centre Manager) has promoted you to Centre Manager, you will **receive an automatic email notification** informing you of this and your Non-clinical Centre Manager will be CC'd.

> Once promoted, you will need to **log out and log in** to your account to see the updated functionalities​.
>
> If your Non-clinical Centre Manager does not respond in 1 week, please forward on your communication to **learningnetwork@nhselect.org.uk** and the NHS Elect team can help
