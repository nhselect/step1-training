6. Select: Enable Editing​

Within the spreadsheet you can:​

- Add a new delegate​
    - Add them as a new row at the bottom of your delegates (do not ‘insert row’ in between existing delegate entries)​
- ​Edit details of an existing delegate​
    - Just replace the information in the cell rows for that delegate​
- Remove a delegate​
    - They will remain on the spreadsheet, but in the ‘Active’ column on the delegates row, just change the cell entry to ‘FALSE’​

8. The following fields are mandatory and must be completed:​

    - LastName​
    - FirstName​
    - JobGroupID -  Need to add the ID # that matches the Job Group on the ‘Job Group’ tab in excel​
        - If delegate was from Nursing / Midwifery, would insert ‘2’​
    - Active - must contain either TRUE or FALSE usually TRUE​
    - E-mail address - ensure that a unique work e-mail address is provided for each delegate (e.g. @nhs.net or nhs.uk)​
    - Has PRN (professional registration number) - must contain either TRUE or FALSE. If set to TRUE a PRN will be required in the next field​
    - PRN - add a PRN if previous prompt is set to TRUE, can be left blank if previous field set to FALSE​

9. Optional fields:​

    - AliasID – Leave blank – this is no longer an active field.​

      - See [Managing registration prompts](/user-guide/centremanager/02-centre-management/configuring-centre-details/managing-registration-prompts) for the prompts we asked you to set up. It is important the answers you write in this spreadsheet are the exact same wording as the optional answers you setup (otherwise it will create an error)​
      - If you do not complete this information in the excel, delegates can also complete it later once registered in their ‘My account’ tab​
