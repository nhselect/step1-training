There are 4 ways that delegates can be registered on the platform, and your Trust will need to decide which to use:

**Self-registration** – a hyperlink is provided and they self-register for a profile. Approval is then required in the platform by either the Clinical Centre Manager or Administrator (unless they have self-register using a Trust computer, and the Trust’s IP address was linked during its setup as a DLS centre, then approval won’t be required)

**Individual registration** – Clinical Centre Manager or Administrator can register individual delegates in the platform (no confirmation is then required)

**Bulk registration** – Clinical Centre Manager or Administrator can register multiple delegates in the platform using an excel upload (no confirmation is then required)

**"Add a member of staff" (For Learners only)** – Educator/Managers can trigger an email invite  to Learners in the platform to self-register (via “Add a member of staff” action) when they go to enrol them on the proficiencies (no confirmation is then required) – Not recommended

In this section, we will show you how to perform the first 3 options.
