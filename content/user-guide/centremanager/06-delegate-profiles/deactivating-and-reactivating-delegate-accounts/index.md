When a delegate no longer requires access or has left the organisation their registration account can be deactivated. When a delegates account is deactivated, they can no longer enrol on any new courses. ​

We are in the process of developing the functionality to move a delegate’s organisation (this should be available approximately January 2023)​

1. Go to Centre dashboard (in ‘Tracking System’ app) ​
2. Select: Delegates​
3. Search: For the delegate​
