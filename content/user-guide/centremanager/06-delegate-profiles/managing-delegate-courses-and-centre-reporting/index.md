#### Managing delegate courses​

This functionality is not relevant for the Step 1 proficiencies, so will show as ‘Not currently registered for any courses’ for all delegates.​

#### Centre reporting​

This functionality is currently in development, so under **Centre reports** on the **Tracking System** application, this will say 'There has not yet been an activity at this centre’​

However, you can export a list of delegate registrations for the Step 1 proficiencies:​

1. Go to **Centre dashboard** (in **Tracking System** application) ​
2. Select: **Delegates**​

4. Select: **Add filter​**
