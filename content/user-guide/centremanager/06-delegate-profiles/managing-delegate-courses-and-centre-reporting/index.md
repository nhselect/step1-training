#### Managing delegate courses

This functionality is not relevant for the Step 1 proficiencies, so will show as ‘Not currently registered for any courses’ for all delegates.

#### Centre reporting

This functionality is currently in development, so under **Centre reports** on the **Tracking System** application, this will say 'There has not yet been an activity at this centre’
