1. Go so the **Centre Dashboard** (in the **Tracking System** application)

There are 4 things you should access:

* **Configuration** - for updating Centre details
* **Delegates** - for managing staff registered on the platform, including promoting to admin roles
* **Admin / Administrators** - for managing staff already promoted to admin roles within the platform
* **Support tickets** - raising a support ticket with HEE TEL for technical queries

> Ignore:
>* **Courses** - This functionality is not relevant for the Step 1 proficiencies. Do not worry that Step 1 is not listed 
>* **Reports** - this functionality is still in development
