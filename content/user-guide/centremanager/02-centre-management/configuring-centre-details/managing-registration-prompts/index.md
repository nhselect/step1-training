When a Learner registers or is registered by the centre for a profile, the system prompts for some basic information: **first name, last name, email address** and **job group**. ​

To make it easier to filter through the Trust's delegate list and, in future, reporting data, we recommend centres add the following **3 mandatory pre-existing prompts /answers** to the registration process:

#### Prompt 1: Programme of study / course ​

* Critical Care Step 1 proficiencies​
* Digital Skills​
* IV passport ​
* Other

> If it is possible that delegates may be enrolled on more than one digital proficiency framework, add the combination as an additional option answer (e.g. Critical care Step 1 proficiencies & IV passport)

#### Prompt 2: Organisation / company​

* *Include all the hospitals in your centre/Trust as options*

#### Prompt 3: Department / team

* *Include all the CC units participating in pilot in your centre/Trust as options*
* Other
