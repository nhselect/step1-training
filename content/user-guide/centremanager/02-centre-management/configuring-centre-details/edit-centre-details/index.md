There are 4 things you can edit under **Centre details**:​

#### Notify email​

* This email address will be notified if delegates from your centre require approval for their profile registration (i.e. if they have self-registered) 
* You can only add one email address, so we suggest it is a shared mailbox (if you would also like to individually receive them, you can [set it on your notification preferences](/user-guide/centremanager/01-registration/managing-your-account/updating-notification-preferences))​

#### Centre support details​

* The centre support details will be displayed to Learners on their Learning Portal (see image below) so they know who to contact for local support.

* If you are an existing DLS centre, Learners completing other proficiency frameworks on the platform will also see these details, so it is important you are specific about Step 1​
* We suggest you add something like:​ 

  > Need support for Step 1 proficiencies? Contact \[add email address], \[add telephone contact number], \[add opening hours])​

#### Centre signature and Centre logo​

* You do not need to add / edit these for now​
