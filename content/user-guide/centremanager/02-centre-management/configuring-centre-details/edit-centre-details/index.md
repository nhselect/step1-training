1. Expand: Centre details​

### To set up for the first time or edit your Centre details

2. Select: Edit ​

There are 4 things you can edit under **Centre details**:​

#### Notify email​
- This email address will be notified if delegates from your centre require approval for their profile registration (i.e. if they have self-registered) 
- You can only add one email address, so we suggest it is a shared mailbox (if you would also like to individually receive them, you can set it on your notification preferences, see p.12–13)​

#### Centre support details​
- The centre support details will be displayed to Learners on their Learning Portal (image to the right) so they know who to contact for local support. ​
- If you are an existing DLS centre, Learners completing other proficiency frameworks on the platform will also see these details, so it is important you are specific about Step 1​
- We suggest you add something like:​ 
    > Need support for Step 1 proficiencies? Contact [add email address], [add telephone contact number], [add opening hours])​

#### Centre signature and Centre logo​
- You do not need to add / edit these for now​
