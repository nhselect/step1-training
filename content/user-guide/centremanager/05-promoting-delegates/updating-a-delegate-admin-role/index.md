For example, promoting to additional roles or de-promoting.

1. Go to Centre dashboard (in ‘Tracking System’ app)

>The Centre administrator list shows only active delegates who have had an admin role assigned to them.  ​
>
> You can search by delegate ​Name, Email address or delegate ID​
>
> If you have [set up additional question prompts](/user-guide/centremanager/02-centre-management/configuring-centre-details/managing-registration-prompts) you can also search for delegates within these, using the ‘Filter by’ drop-down.​

4. Select: Expand to view the delegate registration card​

5. Select: Manage roles​

6. Select or deselect: Centre administrator, Supervisor (Educator / Manager) and/or Nominated Supervisor (Assessor)

Make sure ‘No CMS permissions’ are selected, and you do not need to add a Learning Category (this is a functionality being added for future)​

7. Select: Save​

The delegate's registration card is now tagged with the updated Admin roles ​

> Your delegate will not receive an automatic email notification informing them of the updates to their role so you may wish to inform them of this. 
>
> The delegate will need to log out and log in to their account to see the updated functionalities​​
