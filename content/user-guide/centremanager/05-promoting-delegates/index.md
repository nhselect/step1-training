> Everyone registers to the system as a delegate. The delegate must be approved, have a valid email address and password registered on the system **before they can be promoted** to an admin role ​

There are **4 admin roles** within the platform that delegates can be ‘promoted’ to:​

* **Clinical Centre Manager** – Existing Centre Manager (Clinical or non-clinical) will need to promote the delegate to an Administrator role first, before raising a ticket with HEE TEL to promote them to a Centre Manager role 
* **Administrator** – Only Clinical Centre Manager can promote delegates to this role
* **Educator/Manager** – Only Clinical Centre Manager can promote delegates to this role

  * In the platform this role is called a ‘Supervisor’ ​
* **Assessor** – Only Clinical Centre Manager and Educator/Manager can promote delegates to this role

  * In the platform this role is called a ‘Nominated Supervisor’ ​

During setup, your Trust will need to decide who will perform these different roles. Further information in the ’Platform roles & responsibilities overview material’ in your training package​

Learners should not be promoted to any admin roles. Non-learner delegates should generally only be promoted to one of the admin roles, however there are instances where a delegate may need to be promoted to multiple admin roles, for example:

* **Clinical Centre Manager + Educator/Manager** OR **Assessor** (if the delegate would also need to confirm proficiencies)​
* **Educator/Manager + Administrator** (if your Trust doesn’t have administrators in your unit)
