Within the platform there are 4 ‘admin’ platform roles that delegates can be ‘promoted’ to:​

- Clinical Centre Manager – Only TEL team can promote to​
- Administrator – Only Clinical Centre Manager can promote to​
- Educator / Manager – Only Clinical Centre Manager can promote to​
    - In the platform this role is called a ‘Supervisor’ ​
- Assessor – Only Clinical Centre Manager can promote to​
    - In the platform this role is called a ‘Nominated Supervisor’ ​

During setup, your Trust will need to decide who will perform these different roles. Further information in the ’Platform roles & responsibilities overview material’ in your training package​

Delegates should generally only have 1 role in the platform (and if they are a Learner they should only have this role). However, it is possible for those with admin rights to have dual roles in the platform, if they need some additional functionality. The dual roles we might expect would be:​

- Clinical centre manager + Educator / Manager OR Assessor (if the delegate would also need to confirm proficiencies)​
- Educator / Manager + Administrator (if your Trust doesn’t have administrators in your unit)

> Everyone registers to the system as a delegate. The delegate must be approved, have a valid email address and password registered on the system before they can be promoted to an admin role ​
