1. Go to Centre dashboard (in ‘Tracking System’ app) 

2. Select: Delegates​

3. Search: For the delegate record that you want to promote​

> The All delegates list is filtered by default to show only active delegates.  ​
> 
> You can search by delegate ​Name, Email address or delegate ID​
>
> If you have set up additional question prompts (see p.21–23) you can also search for delegates within these, using the ‘Filter by’ drop-down​

4. Select: Expand to view the delegate registration card

5. ​Select: Manage delegate​

6. Select: Promote to admin​

> Clinical Centre Manager, Educator / Manager, Administrators and Assessors are all ‘admin’ roles in the platform, not just Administrators​

To promote to an admin role​

1. Select: Centre administrator, Supervisor (Educator / Manager) and/or Nominated Supervisor (Assessor)​

​Make sure ‘No CMS permissions’ are selected, and you do not need to add a Learning Category (this is a functionality being added for future)​

2. Select: Save​

The delegate's registration card is now tagged with Admin permissions ​

> ​Your delegate will not receive an automatic email notification informing them of the promotion so you may wish to inform them of this. ​
> 
> The delegate will need to log out and log in to their account to see the updated functionalities​
