Once the **3 mandatory pre-existing prompts /answers** have been set up for your Centre, you will need to answer them for your own delegate account.

> If you registered delegates or delegates self-registered before the registration prompts were set, you will also need to ask them to retrospectively answer the registration prompts via their '**My account**' page

1. Select **My account** page
