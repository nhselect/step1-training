There are 4 things you can edit under **Centre details**:

#### Notify email

* This email address will be notified if delegates from your centre require approval for their profile registration (i.e. if they have self-registered) 
* You can only add one email address, so we suggest it is a shared mailbox (if you would also like to individually receive them, you can [set it on your notification preferences](/centremanager/user-guide/01-registration/managing-your-account/updating-notification-preferences))

#### Centre support details

* The centre support details will be displayed to Learners and Supervisors (Educator/Manager and Assessor) in their applications so they know who to contact for local support

* If you are an existing DLS centre, Learners completing other proficiencies on the platform will also see these details, so it is important you select the appropriate proficiency 
* We suggest you add something like: 

  > Need support for any proficiencies? Contact \[add email address], \[add telephone contact number], \[add opening hours])

#### Centre signature and Centre logo

* You do not need to add / edit these for now
