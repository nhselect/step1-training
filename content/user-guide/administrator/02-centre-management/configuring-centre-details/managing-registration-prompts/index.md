When a Learner registers or is registered by the centre for a profile, the system prompts for some basic information: **first name**, **last name**, **email address** and **job group**.

We recommend centres also add the following additional **mandatory** question prompts/answers, as you will be able to filter delegates by these (to make it easier to navigate) and once reporting is developed, filter your reporting.

We recommend adding the below **3 pre-existing prompts** in the platform, with the below answer options:​

#### Prompt 1: Programme of study / course ​

* Critical Care Step 1 proficiencies​
* Digital Skills​
* IV passport ​
* Other

> If delegates might be enrolled on more than one programme / course, add this as an additional option answer (e.g. Critical care Step 1 proficiencies & IV passport)

#### Prompt 2: Organisation / company​

* *Include all the hospitals in your centre/Trust as options*

#### Prompt 3: Department / team

* *Include all the CC units participating in pilot in your centre/Trust as options*
* Other

> Given these prompts will appear when any delegate registers for your centre (i.e. potentially not only staff using the Step 1 proficiencies), you need to make sure there is an answer that makes sense for staff both completing and not completing the Step 1 proficiencies to select (hence the inclusion of ‘Other’ as an answer option for Prompts 1 and 3.​
