#### Managing delegate courses​

This functionality is not relevant for the Step 1 proficiencies, so will show as ‘Not currently registered for any courses’ for all delegates.​

#### Centre reporting​

This functionality is currently in development, so under ‘Centre reports’ on the Tracking System app, this will say ‘There has not yet been an activity at this centre’.​

However, you can export a list of delegate registrations for the Step 1 proficiencies:​

1. Go to Centre dashboard (in ‘Tracking System’ app) ​
2. Select: Delegates​
