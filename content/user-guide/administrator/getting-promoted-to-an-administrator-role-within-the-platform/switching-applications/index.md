This will take you to the Switch application tab in the blue ribbon, where there are three applications (apps) you can choose from.​

* **Tracking System**: Access to setup or manage your centre, and register, promote and manage delegates in your centre​
* **Legacy Tracking System**: Ignore this, you don’t need to access it. It will only be available for the pilot​
