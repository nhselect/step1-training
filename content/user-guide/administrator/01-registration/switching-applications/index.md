1. Select **Switch application** (this window should automatically appear when you log in)​

This will take you to the Switch application tab in the blue ribbon, where there are three applications (apps) you can choose from.​

- **Learning Portal**: If you are enrolled as a Learner on a course (i.e. another list of proficiencies), you will see this and can access them here​
- **Tracking System**: Access to setup or manage your centre, and register, promote and manage delegates in your centre​
- **Legacy Tracking System**: Ignore this, you don’t need to access it. It will only be available for the pilot​

2. Select **Tracking System​**

> If you don't see the Tracking System app, contact your Clinical Centre Manager to request promotion​.
>
> If you would like to see the appearance and content of the digitised Step 1 proficiencies, a demo can be found in your training package​.
