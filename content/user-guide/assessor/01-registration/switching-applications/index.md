1. Select **Switch application** (this window should automatically appear when you log in)​

This will take you to the Switch application tab in the blue ribbon, where there are two applications (apps) you can choose from.​

- **Learning Portal**: If you are enrolled as a Learner on a course (i.e. another list of proficiencies), you will see this and can access them here​
- **Supervise**: If you are an Educator / Manager or Assessor for any Learners, access to view their progress here​

> If you don't see the **Supervise** app, contact your Clinical Centre Manager to request promotion to an Assessor role within the platform (p 9)​
>
> If you would like to see the appearance and content of the digitised Step 1 proficiencies, a demo can be found in your training package​
