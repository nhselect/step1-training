Similar to the paper version, **Learners are expected to first complete their Learning Contract before starting self-assessment of the Step 1 proficiencies**. This should happen via a discussion with the three stakeholders mentioned:

* Learner
* Lead assessor
* Critical care lead nurse/manager 

The **Learner will need to select ‘Agree’ on behalf of all three stakeholders in their Learning portal** (by selecting Review) following their conversation.

**Confirmation is then required** from either the Assessor, Educator/Manager or Clinical Centre Manager.

The individual who provides confirmation in the platform depends on the proficiency and the Trust:

| Learning contract proficiency     | Confirmation required                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Learner responsibilities          | Assessor. In some Trusts, this may be your Educator/Manager or Clinical Centre Manager |
| Lead assessor responsibilities     | Educator/Manager. In some Trusts, this may be your Assessor.                           |
| Critical care lead nurse / manager | Clinical Centre Manager*. In some Trusts, this may be your Educator/Manager.           |

Note: *The Clinical Centre Manager will need a dual-role in the platform (as also an Educator/Manager or Assessor) in order to be able to confirm in the platform. Otherwise someone else with either of these roles could confirm on their behalf.

#### Confirming agreement to Learning contract

1. Once the Learner has selected ‘Agree’ in their Learning portal and sent to you for confirmation, **you will receive an email from noreply@dls.nhs.uk** (Subject: Self Assessment results review request...) requesting you agree to the Learner contract

> If the confirmation status is **Pending confirmation**, this means it has been sent to another Educator/Manager or Assessor for confirmation, and you will be unable to confirm it.

3. Select **Agree**, type the **First name and Last name** of who you are confirming it for (yourself or whoever is performing that Lead Assessor role) and select **Save and continue**
