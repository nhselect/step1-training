Similar to the paper version, Learners are expected to first complete their Learning Contract before starting self-assessment of the Step 1 proficiencies. This should happen via a discussion with the three stakeholders mentioned:​

* Learner​
* Lead assessor​
* Critical care lead nurse/manager ​

​The Learner will need to select ‘Agree’ on behalf of all three stakeholders in their Learning portal (by selecting Review) following their conversation.​

Confirmation is then required from either the Assessor, Educator / Manager or Clinical Centre Manager.​

The individual who provides confirmation in the platform depends on the proficiency and the Trust:​

| ​Learning contract proficiency​     | Confirmation required​                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ​Learner responsibilities​          | Assessor. In some Trusts, this may be your Educator / Manager or Clinical Centre Manager​ |
| Lead assessor responsibilities​     | Educator / Manager. In some Trusts, this may be your Assessor.​                           |
| Critical care lead nurse / manager​ | Clinical Centre Manager*. In some Trusts, this may be your Educator / Manager.​           |

Note: *The Clinical Centre Manager will need a dual-role in the platform (as also an Educator / Manager or Assessor) in order to be able to confirm in the platform. Otherwise someone else with either of these roles could confirm on their behalf.​

#### Confirming agreement to Learning contract

1. Once the Learner has selected ‘Agree’ in their Learning portal and sent to you for confirmation, you will receive an email from noreply@dls.nhs.uk requesting you agree to the Learner contract​

2. Navigate to the Supervisor Dashboard via the Supervise app in the platform and select the Learner’s request in Your to do list

You will automatically be taken to the Learner’s profile (in the Supervise view)​

> If the confirmation status says ‘Confirmation requested’ this means the proficiency has been sent to you for confirmation. If the status says ‘Pending confirmation’, it has been sent to another supervisor (and you will not be able to confirm that proficiency).​

For proficiencies with ‘Confirmation requested’ status: ​

1. Select: Confirm ​
2. Select: Confirm self-assessment response​
3. Select: Submit​

​Once you have confirmed your agreement to the Learning contract proficiency, the Learner will receive a confirmation email from noreply@dls.nhs.uk​​
