Once your delegate profile has been registered, **your Clinical Centre Manager or Educator/Manager will need to promote you to the Assessor role** (also called 'Nominated Supervisor’) within the platform.​ 

> You will **not** receive an automatic notification (via email or in the platform) that you have been promoted, however the person promoting you should let you know. Alternatively, when you have logged on you will be able to [see in the platform](switching-applications) whether you have been promoted. ​
