As an Assessor you will need to use the **Supervise** application where you can manage Learners on the Step 1 proficiencies

* **Learning Portal**: this is where Learners can access any clinical proficiency frameworks that they are enrolled on. If you are not a Learner, you will not see any clinical proficiency frameworks in the Learning Portal application. If you would like to see what the Digitised Step 1 proficiencies framework looks like, you can access [this demo](https://nhs-step1-proficiencies-demo.netlify.app/), which can also be found in your training package.
