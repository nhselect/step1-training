For each proficiency framework, there are a set of prerequisite steps that the Learner must complete and get signed off before they can begin working through the proficiencies themselves.

For example:

- in the IV Therapy Passport the Learner must record completion of the **[prerequisite learning and assessments](./prerequisites/iv-prerequisites)** that they have completed
- in the Steps proficiencies, the Learner must read and agree to the **[learning contract](./prerequisites/learning-contract)**, which is then also confirmed by both their lead assessor and the critical care lead.

Once the Learner has confirmed their own completion of a record, they need to send this to an Educator/Manager or Assessor, who will then confirm the completion.
