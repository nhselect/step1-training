title: How will we evaluate the pilot and platform?​
updatedAt: 2023-10-03

Trusts and Higher Education Institutes (HEI) will be expected to provide feedback during the pilot. This will include feedback from:

- Implementation Leads
- Clinical Centre Managers
- Educator/Managers
- Assessors
- Learners​

You will be provided with access to these forms when needed - your job is just to complete them when asked​.

Feedback will be collected at different points during the pilot, through:

- online surveys
- 1 to 1 interviews (upto 1 hour per session)
- the online feedback button on the DLS platform

Your insights will be used to optimise the user experience and enhance the DLS service.

If you are performing multiple roles in the platform, you will only need to complete these forms once.
