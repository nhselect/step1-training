Throughout the pilot we will be capturing feedback and data to understand how we can improve the platform and implementation support provided. Where possible we will try to make these improvements during the actual pilot.​

Please do complete the feedback forms provided and encourage others to, as this is our opportunity to make this the best platform possible before it is widely available.  ​

As an **Assessor**, during the pilot we will ask you to feedback on:​

1. Satisfaction with training package materials​
2. Usability of the paper version of the Steps proficiencies (if you have used it before)​
3. Usability of the new digital version of the Steps proficiencies

You will be provided with access to these forms when needed – your job is just to complete them when asked.​

If you are performing multiple roles in the platform, you will only need to complete these forms once.​
