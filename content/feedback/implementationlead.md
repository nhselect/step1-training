Throughout the pilot we will be capturing feedback and data to understand how we can improve the platform and implementation support provided. Where possible we will try to make these improvements during the actual pilot.​

In addition to you completing the feedback forms, as an Implementation Lead we ask for your support in getting your participating staff to complete them as well.​

On the next page are the types of feedback we will be collecting for each role (including Implementation Lead), how we will collect it and when we will collect it.​

If staff are performing multiple roles in the platform (e.g. Clinical Centre Manager and Educator/Manager), they will only need to complete each form once.
