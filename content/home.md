title: Welcome to the training packages for the digitised proficiencies

## What you need to do:

1. **Select the relevant training package** below for the role(s) that you will be performing within the platform. If you are unsure which training package to complete, contact your Implementation Lead or Clinical Centre Manager
2. **Read through all the pre-reading materials** in your training package - this should take 1 to 2 hours in total (you don't need to do this in one session)
3. **Complete the self-declaration and feedback form** within the training package to confirm that you've read each of the required materials. If you are performing more than one role, you only need to complete the self-declaration and feedback form once
4. **Go to the user guide (in your training package) for step-by-step guidance** to start using the platform

**You can revisit the training materials** at any point to refresh your knowledge
