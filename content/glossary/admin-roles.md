title: Admin roles
---
These are the four platform roles (Clinical Centre Manager, Administrator, Educator / Manager and Assessor) that have admin power (i.e. they can control access of roles lower down in the hierarchy).

In order to have these roles in the platform, users need to be promoted into them by someone further up in the hierarchy in the platform. During setup, your Trust will decide who will perform these different rolesâ€‹
