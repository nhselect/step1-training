title: Cohort
---
For this pilot Trusts have been split into 3 cohorts (Cohort 1, Cohort 2, Cohort 3).

The cohort they are in will dictate when they can start setting up (Cohort 1 = mid-Aug ’22, Cohort 2 = mid-Oct ‘22 and Cohort 3 = Jan ‘23).

Trusts may also use the word cohorts to mean groups of Learners starting their Step 1 proficiencies at the same time (but we won’t use it for this any of the materials / platform)
