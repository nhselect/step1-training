Implementation Leads are the Trust-level leads for the Step 1 pilot, and have overall responsibility for the implementation of Step 1 in their organisation.

However, it is not a role in the Step 1 platform - it has been created just for the pilot to help implementation. This is why this training package does not include a user guide for accessing the platform (unlike the other training packages).

For this role, you need to:

1. **Read the [pre-reading materials](#training-prereading)**
2. **Complete the [self-declaration and feedback form](#training-declaration)**
3. **Attend the drop-in sessions** (non-compulsory) that you should have received Outlook calendar invites for, which are an opportunity to bring your queries, hear from other Trusts, and learn about key pilot / platform updates

If you are performing another role in the platform/pilot (e.g. Clinical Centre Manager, Administrator, Educator / Manager or Assessor), you will also need to read the materials in that role’s training package. Some of the materials are the same across all training packages, so you don’t have to re-read these - these are marked with:

<p class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--blue nhsuk-u-font-size-14">This is the same across all training packages</p>

Please note, you only need to complete the self-declaration form once.
