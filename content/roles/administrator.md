The Centre Administrator is responsible for supporting the Clinical Centre Manager with:

  - Setting up and managing your Centre (i.e. Trust or HEI) in the platform
  - Registering / approving self-registration of delegates (i.e. staff) 
  - Sharing and monitoring completion of delegate training packages 
  - Raising Support Tickets within the platform for technical queries on behalf of your team 

Before you can perform this role in the platform, you need to:

1. **Read the [pre-reading materials](#training-prereading)**
2. **Complete the [self-declaration and feedback form](#training-declaration)**
3. **Go to the [User guide](#training-userguide)** to:

    - Self-register or be registered by your Clinical Centre Manager for a platform profile
    - Request promotion to the Centre Administrator role within the platform from your Clinical Centre Manager
    - Access the Tracking system application

If you are performing another role in the platform/pilot (e.g. Educator / Manager or Assessor), you will also need to read the materials in that role’s training package. Some of the materials are the same across all training packages, so you don’t have to re-read these - these are marked with:

<p class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--blue nhsuk-u-font-size-14">This is the same across all training packages</p>

Please note, you only need to complete the self-declaration form once.
