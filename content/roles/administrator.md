The Centre Administrator is responsible for supporting the Clinical Centre Manager with:

  - Setting up and managing your Centre (i.e. Trust) in the platform
  - Registering / approving self-registration of delegates (i.e. staff) 
  - Sharing and monitoring completion of delegate training packages 
  - Raising Support Tickets within the platform for technical queries on behalf of your team 

Before you can perform this role in the platform, you need to:

1. **Read the [pre-reading materials](#training-prereading) in this training package**
2. **Complete the [self-declaration and feedback form](#training-declaration)**
3. **Go to the [user guide](#training-userguide)** for step-by-step guidance on how to:

    - Self-register or be registered by your Clinical Centre Manager for a platform profile
    - Request promotion to the Centre Administrator role within the platform from your Clinical Centre Manager
    - Access the Tracking system application

You may also be performing another role in the platform/pilot (e.g. Educator/Manager or Assessor). If you are, go to that role’s training package after you have read all the below materials, as you only need to complete the self-declaration and feedback form once. Some of the materials are the same across the training packages, so you don’t need to read them twice – these materials will have a blue box that say ‘This material has the same content across all the role training packages’.
