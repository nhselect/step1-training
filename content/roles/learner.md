As a Learner in the platform, you will be able to:

  - Self-assess whether you have ‘achieved’ individual proficiencies
  - Request confirmation of ‘achieved’ proficiencies from your Assessor or Educator/Manager
  - Request final sign-off from your Educator/Manager once all proficiencies have been achieved and confirmed

Before you can perform this role in the platform, you need to:

1. **Read the [pre-reading materials](#training-prereading)**
2. **Complete the [self-declaration and feedback form](#training-declaration)**
3. **Go to the [User guide](#training-userguide)** to:

    - **Self-register or be registered for a platform profile** (your Educator/Manager will tell you which to do) 
    - Be enrolled onto the proficiencies by your Educator/Manager
    - Start self-assessing achievement of proficiencies and requesting confirmation
