As a Learner in the platform, you will be able to:

  - Self-assess whether you have ‘achieved’ individual Step 1 proficiencies
  - Request confirmation of ‘achieved’ Step 1 proficiencies from your Assessor or Educator/Manager
  - Request final sign-off from your Educator/Manager once all Step 1 proficiencies have been achieved and confirmed

Before you can perform this role in the platform, you need to:

1. **Read the [pre-reading materials](#training-prereading) in this training package**
2. **Complete the [self-declaration and feedback form](#training-declaration)**
3. **Go to the [user guide](#training-userguide)** for step-by-step guidance on how to:

    - **Self-register or be registered for a platform profile** (your Educator/Manager will tell you which to do) 
    - Be enrolled onto the Step 1 proficiencies by your Educator/Manager
    - Start self-assessing achievement of Step 1 proficiencies and requesting confirmation
