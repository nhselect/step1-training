As a Learner on the platform, you will be able to self-assess achievement of Step 1 proficiencies on your record, and request confirmation of this achievement from your Assessor or Educator/Manager.

Once you have completed and had confirmed all your Step 1 proficiencies, your Educator/Manager will have responsibility for performing the final sign off and confirming your completion of Step 1.

**For each resource pay particular attention to the sections relating directly to your role as Learner**
