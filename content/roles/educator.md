title: Educator / Manager
order: 4
---
As an Educator/Manager, your responsibilities will include enroling Learners onto the Step 1 proficiencies, confirming your Learners' self-assessed 'achieved' Step 1 proficiencies, and performing final sign off when a Learner has completed all their Step 1 proficiencies.

You will also have some access to register new delegates onto the platform, and to manage delegate profiles, but these are not expected to be necessary for you to do as the Administrators and Clinical Centre Managers in your centre will have responsibility for this.
