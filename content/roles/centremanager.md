title: Clinical Centre Manager
slug: centremanager
order: 2
---
The Clinical Centre Manager role has ultimate responsibility, accountability and governance for all staff using the Step 1 platform, include:

  - Setting up and managing your Centre (i.e. Trust) in the platform 
  - Registering / approving self-registration of delegates (i.e. staff) 
  - Sharing and monitoring completion of delegate training packages 
  - Promoting delegates to admin roles within the platform 
  - Raising Support Tickets within the platform for technical queries on behalf of your team 

Before you can perform this role in the platform, you need to:

1. **Read the [pre-reading materials](#training-prereading)**
2. **Complete the [self-declaration and feedback form](#training-declaration)**
3. **Go to the [User guide](#training-userguide)** to:

    - Self-register for a platform profile
    - Request promotion to a Centre Manager within the platform from your existing Centre Manager
    - Access the Tracking system application

If you are performing another role in the platform/pilot (e.g. Educator / Manager or Assessor), you will also need to read the materials in that role’s training package. Some of the materials are the same across all training packages, so you don’t have to re-read these - these are marked with:

<p class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--blue nhsuk-u-font-size-14">This is the same across all training packages</p>

Please note, you only need to complete the self-declaration form once.
