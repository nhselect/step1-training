## Why have we digitised the Steps proficiencies? 

The Steps proficiencies began as paper documents produced by the Critical Care Networks National Nurse Leads, also known as CC3N. 

In 2021, the CC3N decided to create an online digital version, to allow for improved quality assurance and standardisation of the sign off process.  

This would also allow for: 

- Better use of staff time with more efficient sign-offs
- Faster response to changes in evidence, policy, or population need
- Access to real-time data to inform workforce planning
- Improved mobility, with nurses able to take their Step 1 progress with them
- Reduction in paper waste and environmental impact
- Investment in improving nurses’ digital literacy

Finally, digitising the Steps proficiencies paves the way for future proficiency frameworks in critical care and beyond, to be digitised and hosted in the same place – providing visibility of the skills required at different stages of a nursing career. 

## What was the approach to digitisation? 

The digitised Steps proficiencies are hosted on the Digital Learning Services platform, owned by NHS England’s Technology Enhanced Learning Team.

This platform was originally created to host IT proficiencies, so we at NHS Elect are working closely with NHS England to make sure the platform has the necessary functionality, processes and governance required to host clinical proficiencies.

We have also worked with the CC3N and their educator group, CCNERF, to review and update the proficiency content where required, such as out-of-date guidance, documents or language.

In early 2022 we tested the platform with 17 Trusts and 2 higher education institutes across the country for the Step 1 proficiencies.

From August 2022 to September 2023, we ran a UK-wide digitised Step 1 proficiencies pilot, with 60 NHS Trusts across the country, divided into 3 cohorts.

From October 2023, the Steps 2 and 3 proficiencies will be digitised and piloted by Trusts and their Higher Education Institute partners.

The platform will continue to be available beyond March 2023 and any recorded progress will be kept.

## How are the digitised Steps proficiencies used?

Learners will follow a standard process to complete their digitised Steps proficiencies:

1. They will either be registered, or asked to self-register, as a delegate on the platform. 
2. An Educator/Manager will then enrol the Learner on the relevant digitised Steps  proficiencies in the platform. The proficiencies will then appear in the Learners ‘self-assessments’.
3. As the Learner progresses through their Trust’s Steps training, they will be asked to self-assess in the platform when they have ‘achieved’ a specific proficiency, or select ‘on going assessment’ if it is still in progress.
4. Once a proficiency has been self-assessed as ‘achieved’, Learners then send this to an Educator/Manager or Assessor, set up by their Trust in the platform, for confirmation.
5. The Educator/Manager or Assessor can either ‘accept’ - or ‘reject’ and add an action plan - depending on whether they agree that the Learner is proficient. If a proficiency is confirmed this will update on the Learner’s record.

The Learner will repeat these stages over the following months until all proficiencies have been self-assessed as ‘achieved’, and ‘confirmed’ by an Educator/Manager or Assessor.

At this point, Learners request final sign-off from their Educator/Manager in the platform, which once confirmed will generate a certificate to show their completion of the Step 1 proficiencies.

## How are we collecting feedback? 

As this is a pilot, we are asking delegates to provide feedback over the coming months on the usability of the new digitised Steps  proficiencies and their experience of the pilot.

For those familiar with the paper version we will also ask for their experience of this, to create a baseline.  

Please do complete the feedback forms when provided and encourage others to do so, as this is our opportunity to make this the best platform possible before it is widely available.

## What do you need to do next?  

First, read through the pre-reading materials within the relevant training package. These should provide you with all the information that you need to know before you start using the platform. 

Once you have looked through these materials, please complete the self-declaration and feedback form within your training package  – this will generate a certificate to recognise your completion.  

You should then follow the stages in the relevant user guide for your role to start using the platform. This is also where you will find the link to access the platform.
