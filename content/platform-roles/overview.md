Everyone who registers onto the platform is called a **delegate**.

## Admin roles

Within the platform there are 4 admin roles:

- Centre Manager
- Centre Administrator
- Educator/Manager
- Assessor

Each role has access to specific functionalities (applications) within the platform.

During setup, your Trust (e.g. Implementation Lead or Centre Manager) will decide who will perform these different admin roles.

Multiple delegates can perform each role (i.e. multiple Assessors) and, in some instances, a delegate may require more than one admin role (i.e. Center Manager and Educator/Manager).

Delegates requiring admin functionalities need to be promoted within the platform. **Centre Managers** can promote delegates to any admin role and **Educator/Managers** can promote delegates to the Assessor role.

## Learners

To become a **Learner**, a delegate will need to be enrolled onto a framework (e.g. Step 1 proficiencies) by an **Educator/Manager**.

**Click on the roles in the hierarchy to learn more about the different roles, their key responsibilities and examples of who can perform these roles within your Trust.**

Please note, the Implementation Lead is not a platform role and has been created to support implementation of the digitised Step 1 proficiencies pilot within your Trust
