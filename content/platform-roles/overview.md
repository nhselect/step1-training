## Introduction

Everyone who registers onto the platform is called a **delegate**.

### Admin roles

Within the platform there are 4 **admin roles**:

<p>
<span class="nhsuk-tag step1-roles-color__dark-blue">
  Centre Manager
</span>
<span class="nhsuk-tag step1-roles-color__light-blue">
  Centre administrator
</span>
<span class="nhsuk-tag step1-roles-color__grey-2">
  Educator / Manager
</span>
<span class="nhsuk-tag step1-roles-color__aqua-green">
  Assessor
</span>
</p>

During setup, your Trust (your Implementation Lead or Centre Manager) will decide who will perform these different admin roles.

Multiple delegates can perform each role (for example, your Trust can have multiple Assessors) and, in some instances, a delegate may require more than one admin role (for example, both Centre Manager and Educator/Manager).

Delegates performing admin roles will need to be promoted within the platform (Centre Managers can promote delegates to any role and Educator/managers can only promote delegates to the Assessor role).

Once promoted, each role has access to specific applications within the platform:

### Learners

To become a **Learner**, a delegate will need to be enrolled onto the appropriate **Steps , 2 or 3 proficiencies** framework by an **Educator/Manager**.

Once enrolled, Learners can access the proficiencies through the Learning Portal application.

## Platform roles, responsibilities and examples

**Click on the roles in the hierarchy to learn more about the different roles, their key responsibilities and examples of who can perform these roles within your Trust.**

Please note, the Implementation Lead is **not a platform role** and has been created to support implementation of the digitised Steps proficiencies pilot within your Trust
