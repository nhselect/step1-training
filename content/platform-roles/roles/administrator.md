- Unit ward clerk or Ward administrator​ or other admin role
- If your Trust does not have appropriate admin staff, this role could be assigned as an additional role to someone already holding the Educator/Manager role​

#### Higher education institute example

- Other course lectures within the team. This person can hold multiple roles so can also still act as an Educator/Manager within the platform
