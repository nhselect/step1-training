        Community Diagnostic Centres (CDC) tie together different work systems and people, such as patients, their family members, carers, clinical and administrative staff in the CDCs, hospital-based specialists, managers, staff working in community roles, the patient's GP and many more.
      </p>
      <p>
        All these people and roles have diverse needs and capabilities, which need to be understood.
