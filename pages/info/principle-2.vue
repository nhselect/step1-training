        Task Analysis provides a thorough understanding of work-as-done, which can inform us about other elements of the work system, such as other tasks that must be carried out, other people who are involved, the tools and the equipment that are going to be used, the physical spaces where the tasks are carried out, and the procedures, protocols and organisational structures that are in place.

              Task inventories were constructed for the tasks involved in (a) doing an echocardiogram (echo) and (b) running a pacing clinic.
            </p>
            <p>
              The analysis suggests that there might be scope for a support role for echo, but less so for the pacing clinic. However, wider systems factors should be considered, e.g., job satisfaction for both the physiologist and the potential support role, job design and career prospects for the support role.
