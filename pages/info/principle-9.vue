            <p>Emphasis should be on learning from everyday work (rather than just from incidents) in order to understand how people adapt to situations and changes; staff should have an active role to play in organisational learning in order to ensure that learning is meaningfully related to practice; and where possible staff should be encouraged to take ownership for taking changes forward, and should be given authority and resource to do so.</p>
            <p>Finally, any changes that are implemented will likely require further adjustments over time, and therefore the learning process should be continuous and feedback from staff should be sought and given.</p>
