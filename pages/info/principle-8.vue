        Ineffective digital communication processes, e.g., email communication between CDCs and GP practices, can lead to delays, duplication, and loss of trust. Conversely, digital communication technologies embedded in well-designed processes that consider the diverse needs of the different stakeholders can save time, deliver a more joined-up service, and improve patient experience.

              <p><strong>Communication with GP practices:</strong></p>
              <p>Observations revealed instances where staff were reluctant to phone GPs to escalate test results due to concerns about the time this would require.  On one occasion a member of staff was observed being on hold for 11 minutes while phoning the GP practice.</p>
              <p>Staff also expressed a lack of trust in the email system, with doubts about whether information would be received, looked at and acted upon in a timely fashion.</p>
              <p>Further, during the observations staff spent more than 30 minutes per shift responding to GP emails asking for reports that had already been sent. In each case the task was repeated, and a reply email written.</p>
              <p>Phone calls to reception included patients who had been asked by their GP to call and chase results that had already been sent.  This does not instil confidence in the system, and results in task duplication and an administrative burden.</p>
              <p>There are clear opportunities for improvement through better designed communication processes across systems and organisations.</p>
